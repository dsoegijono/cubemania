Redesign:
  inaktive user anzeigen überflüssig mit neuem system :)
  puzzle - points - user table erst user eintragen, wenn er min. ein match gemacht hat. (find_or_create)
  Display the time each player has wasted solving cubes.

Chart:
  Small chart for scrolling and zooming
  Threshold at where your best x averages lie below
  Remove data point from Chart after destroying it

General:
  make a general cache_key(args*) helper method which joins with "/"
  Remove Timer JS Code to external JS file. Use the data-attributes for urls and stuff. Also remove all link_to_functions
  Puzzle#destroy is missing
  Reduce the size of averages.json to fit more averages into memcache (create tooltip at client side and only send raw data)
  Better cache expiration for averages. At the moment all averages of one user get expired if he creates a new average.
  Make facebook connection more fluent. If "Share it!" fails, user shouldn't do anything to share it anyway.
  6x6 and 7x7 scramble shouldn't contain html tags.

Random ideas:
  Gray out comments from users, which are stupid. (http://www.joystiq.com/2010/03/17/steam-on-mac-os-x-interview/#comments)

Matches should be destroyable, but only through a destroy request including a reason why the user wants to delete that match.
Ask Patrick for a user's statistics table.
User#index becomes the ranking page.

Matches:
  Every Match has shouts
  Design results page
  Email the opponent if he has a new challenge

Enhancements:

  Protect Attributes (User Update, Competition Update) # override User#write_attribute <--- nope, that's an ugly solution. take a look at the competitions and
                                                         users controller. the code is already in there:
                                                               #protect :sticky, :but => :admin, :only => [:create, :update]
                                                         read it like: protect attribute sticky from everyone but admins (only necessary for create and update)
                                                         the protect method should be put into the authentication plugin. would also be nice to split the
                                                         authentication class into authentication and authorization.
