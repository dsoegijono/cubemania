Enhancements:

  Protect Attributes (User Update, Competition Update) # override User#write_attribute <--- nope, that's an ugly solution. take a look at the competitions and
                                                         users controller. the code is already in there:
                                                               #protect :sticky, :but => :admin, :only => [:create, :update]
                                                         read it like: protect attribute sticky from everyone but admins (only necessary for create and update)
                                                         the protect method should be put into the authentication plugin. would also be nice to split the
                                                         authentication class into authentication and authorization.
