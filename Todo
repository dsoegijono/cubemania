COMPETITIONS!

Some basic thoughts:
* Every user can create a competition and becomes the competition owner.
* Each competition has several "competition events" (e.g. weekly contest #31 of the p0rn0 competition)
* Every user can take part in several competitions (competitions_users table)
* Each competition can have any amount of puzzles (1 to Puzzle.count) (competition_puzzles table)
* Competitions are held once per week, once per day or just once in earth's life ;) (competitions.duration(?))
* Each Competition event must have equal scrambles for each competitor.
* Maybe we don't need the competition_events table if we use clocks.created_at to split all solves for a competition into different weeks.

Every week happens the following (if we use an extra competition_events table):
* create a new compeition event for the competition and set it's expire_date.
 (if we don't use an extra competition_events table):
* save the scrambles for each puzzle and each attempt somewhere

Comeptition#show:
* Equal to timer, except: replace the chart with the current results of the competitors and remove/mark all puzzles which aren't part of
  the competition. Also: Disable the timer/submit button after the competitor has submitted his result.

Some further thoughts for future releases:
* The winner gets x points, the second one x*0.5 points, the third one 1/3*x...
* private compeitions (password protected/invitatin only)
* comment feature for each competition event. to discuss easy scrambles, awesome solves and ...

Competition conclusion:
* OMG! Let's start simple:

competitions
  - name
  - format ('weekly', 'daily', 'once')
  - user_id (owner)
  
competitions_users
  - user_id
  - competition_id

competitions_puzzles
  - user_id
  - puzzle_id
  - scrambles(?)


* Admin-Interface
* Loeschen von Usern für Moderatoren
* Bei Rekorden die Einzelzeiten auflisten
* Bild vom gecrambleten puzzle (schwierig, aber bestimmt spaßig ;))
