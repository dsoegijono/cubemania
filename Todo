  Import for cct session?

User's profile:
  Rowe spent <strong>4 days 12 hours 21 minutes and 3 seconds</strong> cubing!
Facebook:

                                        :name => @puzzle.name + ' ' + @puzzle.kind.name,
                                        :description => 'Keep track of your times and join Cubemania',
                                        :link => user_url(@average.user_id, :host => "cubemania.org"),

General:
  make a general cache_key(args*) helper method which joins with "/"
  Remove Timer JS Code to external JS file. Use the data-attributes for urls and stuff. Also remove all link_to_functions
  Puzzle#destroy is missing
  Reduce the size of averages.json to fit more averages into memcache (create tooltip at client side and only send raw data)
  Better cache expiration for averages. At the moment all averages of one user get expired if he creates a new average.
  Make facebook connection more fluent. If "Share it!" fails, user shouldn't do anything to share it anyway.

Random ideas:
  Gray out comments from users, which are stupid. (http://www.joystiq.com/2010/03/17/steam-on-mac-os-x-interview/#comments)

  Protect Attributes (User Update, Competition Update) # override User#write_attribute <--- nope, that's an ugly solution. take a look at the competitions and
                                                         users controller. the code is already in there:
                                                               #protect :sticky, :but => :admin, :only => [:create, :update]
                                                         read it like: protect attribute sticky from everyone but admins (only necessary for create and update)
                                                         the protect method should be put into the authentication plugin. would also be nice to split the
                                                         authentication class into authentication and authorization.
