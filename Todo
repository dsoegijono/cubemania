Timer: Amount of solves relies on scrambles.length, but the underlying javascript relies on @puzzle.attempt_count. This could (maybe) lead to problems.
  I'll keep an eye on it :).

  chart: coloring
  IE6: We had 20++ unique visitors who used IE6. Grml.

  Proper route for competitions index repeat
  Reevaluate Indexes and Includes
  Competitions: Challange another user
  Competitions: Add notice for new record
  Chart: Either limit the amount of averages or add a scrollbar. It's too hard to navigate to one specific average. <-- There IS a scrollbar! Just beneath the chart! <-- Uhm, yeah, i didn't see it. But that's more a scalebar than a scrollbar. We should stick to a scale of about 30(?) averages per "page" and use the scrollbar to scroll through the solves.
  Allow ignoring users for moderators.
  Records: Write a method which repairs record flags.

  Timer: Add the countdown again + let the user disable the countdown (and save his decision)
